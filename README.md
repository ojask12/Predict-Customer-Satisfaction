# Predict-Customer-Satisfaction

Customer satisfaction is defined as a measurement that determines how happy customers are with a company’s products, services, and capabilities. Customer satisfaction information, including surveys and ratings, can help a company determine how to best improve or changes its products and services. An organization’s main focus must be to satisfy its customers. This applies to industrial firms, retail and wholesale businesses, government bodies, service companies, nonprofit organizations, and every subgroup within an organization [1].

Satisfaction is a major outcome of marketing activity and serves to link processes culminating in purchase and consumption with postpurchase phenomena such as attitude change, repeat purchase, and brand loyalty. The centrality of the concept is reflected by its inclusion in the marketing concept that profits are generated through the satisfaction of consumer needs and wants [2].

It can be very valuable for a corporation to flag a potential dissatisfied customer in early stages of engagement, to then course correct and improve customer happiness. To this end, this project explores the viability of developing a machine learning model that can predict customer satisfaction with high accuracy.
