Satisfaction is a major outcome of marketing activity and serves to **link processes culminating in purchase** and consumption with postpurchase phenomena such as **attitude change, repeat purchase, and brand loyalty**. From frontline support teams to C-suites, customer satisfaction is a key measure of success. 


> Customer satisfaction is defined as a measurement that determines how happy customers are with a company’s products, services, and capabilities. Customer satisfaction information, including surveys and ratings, can help a company determine how to best improve or changes its products and services. An organization’s main focus must be to satisfy its customers. This applies to industrial firms, retail and wholesale businesses, government bodies, service companies, nonprofit organizations, and every subgroup within an organization.


Unhappy customers don't stick around. What's more, unhappy customers rarely voice their dissatisfaction before leaving. It can be very valuable for a corporation to flag a potential dissatisfied customer in early stages of engagement, to then course correct and improve customer happiness.

For this project, we will be using data provided by Santander Bank. The bank has provided information collected throughout the customer journey and the associated end of journey outcome of customer satisfaction. Furthermore, a key challenge comes from the fact that the bank has anonymized the features provided, rendering feature interpretation impossible.


However, it is still possible to identify high impact predictors which will be of great use for the Santander Bank.
